I first started programming in my junior year of
high school, taking a required computer science class.
This is not what drove me to love programming, in fact, this class
might have driven me _away_ from programming (probably due to
the language taught being C++). My passion for programming
came when I was in college, and I had taken an interest in
the stock market. I would use the web to research the stocks
I was interested in buying, but I was dissatisfied by the
amount and quality of information that I was provided. This is
when I decided I was going to make my own website that
displayed all of the information I wanted to see. I had no
idea that this one little project would open up a wide door
into a world I didn't know existed, and would end up
loving. I _love_ to code, and no matter what I'm doing,
when I learn something new about programming, I feel that
same wide door opening again into a different world.
