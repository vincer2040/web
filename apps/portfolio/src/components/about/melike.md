### What I like building

Burnout is a something that a lot of software engineers
feel. I know I have felt it, and I believe I have found a
cure for it; you have to find what it was that made you
passionate about programming to begin with. I have found that
what makes me passionate is solving data-oriented problems -
how it gets transformed from an API to a user, how its represented
in memory, etc. This is why I really enjoyed building
[LexiDB](/projects/db/), which is an in-memory database written
in C. I got to use different types of data structures (hashmaps,
hashsets, vectors, queues, stacks, priority-queues, trees,
and graphs) to represet data. Thinking about the data and how
it can be efficiently stored and accessed is my favorite thing
to do in software.
