### Development Environment

I develop on linux with neovim as my editor (you can find my
config [here](https://github.com/vincer2040/init.lua) if
you're interested in that sort of stuff) and tmux (I don't have
a config for tmux as I just use the defaults) as my terminal.

I started using Arch Linux about a year ago, after having used
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL was a great introduction to
linux; I learned a lot about the linux command line tools such as
grep, awk, sed, etc and how simple they were to use and how
powerful they can be. Using these commands was my first introduction to
the Unix philosophy of having a tool do one thing very well. I really
liked that philosophy, and with me being a minimalist at heart, I
was driven to Arch Linux due to it's minimalistic operating system. Fully
installing and configuring my system did take some time, but I learned
a lot about my computer and linux during it. Having to manually set up
systemD, wifi, data and time, fonts, etc really taught me lot about
how linux works. Indirectly, this taught me a lot about setting up
docker containers and servers in the cloud.

Before using neovim, I started with vim, and before that, VS code.
VS code was great when I first started learning how to code - I didn't
have to overcome the learning curve required to use vim effectively while
learning how to code. I ending up switching to vim after seeing
other developers use it and how efficient they were with it. Looking back,
I really dislike how VS code hides a lot about how its internals work (ie
"autocomplete"). Using neovim and configuring it myself taught me how
plugins in VS code actually worked - there is a language server running
in the background that communicates with the editor that provides these
completions. I chose not to use a neovim "distrobution" for this same reason;
I wanted to learn how these things actually work.

Despite being an Arch and neovim user, believe it or not, I don't spend
much time customizing my configuration files. I only use three-four applications;
the terminal, neovim, chrome, and spotify. I don't aspire to have a really
cool looking user interface, I aspire to have a system that allows me to create
software effectively and efficiently. Using a minimalastic operating system
such as Arch and with a highly-customizable editor in neovim, I am able to do
just that.
