### Overview

Heavily inspired by Redis, this project is an an in-memory data structure database implemented in C.
The goal of this project was to have a server where users can store key-value pairs,
queues, stacks, hashsets, and namespaced collections of the former data structures. I've been
working on this project for about a year, and it is my largest project.

I have implemented client libraries in C, C++, typescript/javascript, Java, Go, and Rust.
