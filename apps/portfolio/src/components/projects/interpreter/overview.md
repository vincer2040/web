### Overview

This project is an interpreter written in Rust, following
the incredible books "Writing an Interpreter in Go" and "Writing a Compiler
in Go" by Thorsten Ball. Throughout the development of this project, I
learned a lot about interpreted languages like JavaScript and Python, and
how _difficult_ it must have been to make those languages performant (JavaScript
is technically just-in-time compiled, but I think that makes the performance more impressive).
I acquired a much greater appreciation for how those languages work,
and really admire how fast some of these interpreted languages are,
given how much memory and work by the CPU they require.
