### Overview

This project is an interpreter written in C, following
the incredible book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball.
Throughout the development of this project, I learned a lot about
interpreted languages like JavaScript and Python, and how _difficult_
it is for those languages to be performant. I acquired a much greater
appreciation for how these languages work, and really admire how
fast some of these interpreted languages are, given how much memory and work they
require.
